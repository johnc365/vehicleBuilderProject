## Installation

In order to install this project, you will need node installed on your computer. You will also need to install the inquier package from npm. Then you can simply use the GitHub link provided at the bottom of this page to navigate to my GitHub repository where you can access the code to copy or download the program file.

## Usage

You will need node to use this program. If you do not have node installed on your computer, install it now. Once you have node, you can open your terminal and navigate to the directory in which the Cli.ts file is stored. Then, type "node start" into the command line. You will then be able to navigate through a menu of vechicles and perform a variety of functions with them or get detailed information on a particular vehicle.
